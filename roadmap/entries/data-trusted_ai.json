  "categoryDescription": "Today, users have to blindly trust AI models running on centralized servers with no visibility into how data is used and how AI models produce responses. Decentralized AI solves this problem by bringing the trustworthiness, security, verifiability, and resilience of smart contracts to AI applications.",

      "description": "AI agents are a growing paradigm in software, and the Internet Computer is uniquely positioned to be the home of AI agents. Compared to the traditional IT stack, AI agents on the Internet Computer can securely and easily manage digital assets, transact amongst each other, be fully sovereign, and be tokenized and managed by DAOs. This milestone focuses on providing access to foundational LLMs, along with basic tools to make it as simple as possible to deploy agents on the Internet Computer.",
