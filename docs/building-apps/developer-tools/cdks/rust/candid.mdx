# Using the Candid UI with a Rust canister

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate", "Rust", "Tutorial"]} />

Candid is an **interface description language** with the primary purpose of describing the public interface of a service. A service is usually in the form of a program deployed as a canister. Candid is language-agnostic, meaning that it allows for the interoperation between services and frontends written in different programming languages, including Rust.

## Interacting with a service from a Rust canister

For developing Rust canisters on ICP, you will need the following tools and packages:

<TabItem value="prereq" label="Prerequisites" default>

<input type="checkbox"/> <a href="/docs/building-apps/getting-started/install">Install the IC SDK.</a> Note: While using the IC SDK is the typical path for most developers, experienced Rust developers may choose to circumvent IC SDK entirely and use the <a href="https://github.com/dfinity/cdk-rs"> Rust CDK </a> directly.
<div>
</div>
<input type="checkbox"/> <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html">Download and install Rust.</a>
<div>
</div>
<input type="checkbox"/> Download and install the <code>wasm32-unknown-unknown</code> target: <code>rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown</code>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

When writing a canister in Rust, the `dfx build` command will ensure that the canister's service description is correctly referenced. The Candid service description, however, will need to be manually written following the writing conventions described in the [Candid specification](https://github.com/dfinity/candid/blob/master/spec/Candid.md#core-grammar).

:::info
In versions of the Rusk CDK `v0.11.0` and higher, the Candid export workflow has been changed.
You can call the `ic_cdk::export_candid!()` macro to enable the Candid export behavior, then use the [candid-extractor](https://github.com/dfinity/cdk-rs/tree/main/src/candid-extractor) to extract the Candid from the canister's Wasm.

The following example code displays how a Candid interface can be used to interact with a simple counter application written in Rust.

```rust title="src/counter_backend/src/lib.rs"
use ic_cdk::{
    api::call::ManualReply,
    export::{candid, Principal},
    init, query, update,
};
use std::cell::{Cell, RefCell};

thread_local! {
    static COUNTER: RefCell<candid::Nat> = RefCell::new(candid::Nat::from(0));
    static OWNER: Cell<Principal> = Cell::new(Principal::from_slice(&[]));
}

#[init]
fn init() {
    OWNER.with(|owner| owner.set(ic_cdk::api::caller()));
}

#[update]
fn inc() {
    ic_cdk::println!("{:?}", OWNER.with(|owner| owner.get()));
    COUNTER.with(|counter| *counter.borrow_mut() += 1u64);
}

#[query(manual_reply = true)]
fn read() -> ManualReply<candid::Nat> {
    COUNTER.with(|counter| ManualReply::one(counter))
}

#[update]
fn write(input: candid::Nat) {
    COUNTER.with(|counter| *counter.borrow_mut() = input);
}
```

This canister would use the following Candid file:

```candid title="src/counter_backend/counter_backend.did"
service : {
  "inc": () -> ();
  "read": () -> (nat) query;
  "write": (nat) -> ();
}
```

## Using Candid UI in the browser

To use Candid UI in a web browser, first you need to deploy your canister.

:::info
If you need to learn how to create a new `dfx` project to insert these files into, please see the [introduction to Rust canisters](intro-to-rust.mdx).
:::

```bash
dfx deploy
```

The output of the `dfx deploy` command will resemble:

```bash
Deployed canisters.
URLs:
  Frontend canister via browser
    counter_frontend: http://127.0.0.1:4943/?canisterId=ajuq4-ruaaa-aaaaa-qaaga-cai
  Backend canister via Candid interface:
    counter_backend: http://127.0.0.1:4943/?canisterId=aovwi-4maaa-aaaaa-qaagq-cai&id=a4tbr-q4aaa-aaaaa-qaafq-cai
```

To use the Candid UI, navigate to the link specified as the 'Backend canister via Candid interface' URL. In the browser, the Candid UI will look like this:

[Candid UI](../rust/_attachments/CandidUI.png)

This UI interface can be used to call the functions of the `counter` canister.

## Using Candid for interactions between canisters

For example, if you want to write a `hello` canister that calls the `counter` canister in Rust, the code for the `hello` canister will resemble the following:

``` rust title="src/hello_backend/src/lib.rs"
use ic_cdk_macros::*;

#[import(canister = "counter")]
struct Counter;

#[update]
async fn greet() -> String {
    let result = Counter::inc(1.into()).await;
    format!("The current counter is {}", result)
}
```

### What this code does

When the import macro on the `counter` canister (the `#[import(canister = "counter")]` declaration) is processed by the `dfx build` command, the `dfx build` command ensures that the `counter` canister identifier and the Candid description are passed to the Rust CDK correctly.

The Rust CDK then translates the Candid type into the appropriate native Rust type. This translation enables you to call the `inc` method natively, as if it were a Rust function, even if the `counter` canister is implemented in a different language or if you do not have the source code for the imported canister.

For additional information on the type mapping between Candid and Rust, you can consult the [supported types](/docs/references/candid-ref) reference section.

For other canisters and tools to interact with the `hello` canister, you need to manually create a `.did` file with the content:

``` candid title="src/hello_backend/hello_backend.did"
service : {
    greet : () -> (text);
}
```
