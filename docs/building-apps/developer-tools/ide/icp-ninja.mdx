# ICP Ninja

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "IDE"]} />

[ICP Ninja](https://icp.ninja/) is a web-based code editor and deployment environment for ICP canister smart contracts. Users can choose from a gallery of example projects, then edit and deploy the project directly to ICP without downloading `dfx` or obtaining cycles. Projects will be live for 20 minutes unless redeployed. The deployment timer resets on each deployment.

Currently, ICP Ninja supports writing and deploying Motoko backend canisters and React frontend canisters.

## Limitations

ICP Ninja is currently undergoing active development and has implemented a few limitations that should be noted. These limitations will be removed and changed as the platform develops.

- **Chain Fusion**: ICP Ninja currently does not support ICP's Chain Fusion features, such as signing and submitting transactions on other chains or making calls to the EVM RPC canister.

- **Supported packages**: Only certain npm packages are supported by ICP Ninja projects. The `package-lock.json` file in each project contains the supported list. This list cannot be edited.

- **Project structure**: Projects created and deployed on ICP Ninja must follow a specific project structure. They can only contain at maximum two canisters, a backend and a frontend. The frontend source code folder may only contain one subfolder, `frontend/src`.
