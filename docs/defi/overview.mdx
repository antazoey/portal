# Developing DeFi applications

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Tokens"]} />

[Rosetta](https://www.rosetta-api.org/) is an open standard introduced by Coinbase to simplify the integration of tokens in applications and services such as exchanges, block explorers, and wallets. It can be used for workflows such as deploying a token on ICP that aims to be tradable on CeFi exchanges or if you are working on a block explorer or wallet. Rosetta is a popular tool used when developing DeFi applications on ICP such as decentralized exchanges; however, it is not the only way to build DeFi apps on ICP.

There are two implementations of the Rosetta-API standard. One for the [ICP Ledger](/docs/defi/rosetta/icp_rosetta/index) and the other for ledgers that implement the [ICRC-1](/docs/defi/rosetta/icrc_rosetta/index) standard.

## Types of tokens

ICP tokens are used for different actions on the network, such as being converted into <GlossaryTooltip>[cycles](/docs/building-apps/getting-started/tokens-and-cycles)</GlossaryTooltip> to pay for a <GlossaryTooltip>canister</GlossaryTooltip>'s resources, or being staked in a neuron to receive voting power on the [<GlossaryTooltip>NNS</GlossaryTooltip>](https://internetcomputer.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/33692645961236-NNS-Network-Nervous-System).

[ICRC](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC) stands for `Internet Computer Request for Comments` and is a working group for various topics. ICRC tokens adhere to one of the ICRC standards. Such standards define parameters like which features and metadata the token's ledger must support. ICRC standards can be created for anything, not just token types. Currently, the protocol supports the ICRC token standards ICRC-1, ICRC-2, ICRC-3, and ICRC-7, with several more in the process of being drafted and developed.

[Chain-key](/docs/defi/chain-key-tokens/overview) tokens are created using ICP's chain-key cryptography protocols including [threshold signing](/docs/building-apps/network-features/signatures/t-ecdsa) and adhere to the ICRC standards such as ICRC-1 and ICRC-2. For example, the chain-key tokens ckBTC, ckETH, and ckERC20 use ICRC-1 ledgers that support the ICRC-2 extension. Each chain-key token is deployed on ICP and backed 1:1 with the native token, such as BTC, ETH, or ERC20, locked and kept on their native chain. There are no intermediaries or centralized bridges used for chain-key tokens.

Older token standards, [DIP-20](https://github.com/Psychedelic/DIP20) and [DIP-721](https://github.com/Psychedelic/DIP721), are designed to resemble the Ethereum ERC-20 and ERC-721 standards, respectively. While some projects on ICP still use DIP-20 and DIP-721, the new ICRC-2 and ICRC-7 standards are designed to provide a newer, alternative standard for each.

Each token standard is elaborated on in the [token standards documentation](/docs/defi/token-standards/).

## DeFi terminology on ICP

- **Principal**: An entity that can be authenticated by ICP. Principals are used to identify canisters, individuals, services, ledger accounts, or other components deployed on ICP. A <GlossaryTooltip>principal</GlossaryTooltip> can have multiple accounts because you can change the bytes of the subaccount. Principals are ICP's representation of a public key of a user.

- **Subaccount**: An optional 32-byte array. Together a principal and a subaccount form an account according to the ICRC-1 standard.

- [**Account**](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1/blob/main/standards/ICRC-1/README.md#account): Used by ICRC ledgers, it is defined as a struct that contains a `principal` and an optional `subaccount` in the format of `(principal, subaccount)`. `Account` can be converted into an `AccountIdentifier` but not vice versa.

- [**AccountIdentifier**](https://mmapped.blog/posts/13-icp-ledger#account-id): Used by the ICP ledger, defined as essentially a hash of the ICRC-1 `Account` value. The ICP ledger can never have the same internal representation as ICRC ledgers.

- **Wallet**: On ICP, a wallet refers to an asset custody solution for ICP tokens, ICRC-1 tokens, cycles, NFTs, or other digital assets.

- **Ledger**: Used to record transactions in a chain of blocks. A ledger serves transaction requests and offers a variety of endpoints to fetch data and information about its state.

- **Index**: Allows for querying a transaction list for a specific account rather than querying a ledger's entire history. Indexes can also serve blocks like the ledger and are actually the preferred method of doing so.

- **Decentralized exchange**: A peer-to-peer marketplace for buying, selling, and transferring tokens.

## Ledgers

Ledgers are used to record transactions in a chain of blocks. One block specifications its parent block, forming a blockchain that is immutable without changing all previous blocks in the chain.

Currently, on the Internet Computer you will find two different types of ledgers:

- The ICP ledger canister that is running on the [NNS](https://internetcomputer.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/33692645961236-NNS-Network-Nervous-System): Used to record `burn`, `mint`, `approve`, and, most commonly, `transfer` transactions with regards to ICP's native [token](/docs/defi/token-standards/) `ICP`. The ICP ledger canister services transaction requests and offers a variety of endpoints to fetch data and information about the state of the ICP ledger.

- ICRC-1 ledgers: Required for creating a new token. ICRC-1 is a standard created by the Ledger and Tokenization Technical Working Group that defines the general functionalities of ledgers. All tokens and their corresponding ledgers that wish to support this standard have to fulfill all requirements specified in the standard. View the full description of the [ICRC-1 standard](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1/blob/main/standards/ICRC-1/README.md).

#### Difference between the ICP ledger and ICRC-1 ledgers

The ICP ledger does not follow an official standard. It was created before the ICRC-1 standard had been conceptualized and created.

ICRC-1 is a standard, not a specific implementation of a ledger. There is a [reference implementation](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/tree/master/rs/ledger_suite/icrc1/ledger) created by DFINITY, but there may be different ICRC-1 ledgers with different implementations that all follow the same standard.

The ICRC-1 reference implementation and the ICP ledger have different endpoints, different transaction and block objects, and quite a few other, more subtle, differences.

The ICP ledger implements all endpoints defined in the ICRC-1 standard; however, this does not mean that the ICP ledger is an ICRC-1 ledger. The ICRC-1 standard clearly defines how an `Account` should be represented, while the ICP ledger uses `AccountIdentifiers`.

Should a future ICRC-1 extension standard or the use of index canisters result in the exposure of the internal representation of accounts, any ICRC-1 ledger will deviate from the ICP ledger.

See the documentation on [how to interact with the ICRC ledger for more info](/docs/defi/token-ledgers/setup/icrc1_ledger_setup).

## Indexes

If you want to fetch transactions for a specific `Account` or `AccountIdentifier` you would have to first query all blocks and transactions from the ICP or an ICRC-1 compatible ledger, then search through them for transactions in which the `Account` or `AccountIdentifier` was involved. To solve this issue, index canisters exist. The index canisters allow for the querying of transaction lists for a specific account. Furthermore, they offer endpoints for querying the current balance of an account, and you can also fetch blocks from one of their endpoints.

There are two different types of index canisters: one for the [ICP ledger](/docs/defi/token-indexes/) and one for [ICRC-1 compatible ledgers](/docs/defi/token-indexes/). Due to the previously mentioned difference between the ICP ledger and ICRC-1 ledgers, these two index canisters do not use identical endpoints. Since one uses `Account` and the other uses `AccountIdentifier` as an internal representation of accounts, the returned transactions will differ in this regard.

## Cycles

When a canister is deployed onto the ICP mainnet, it is required to pay for the resources it uses, such as storage and compute. To pay for these resources, developers need to use cycles. A developer can top up their canisters with cycles by converting ICP tokens into cycles and then depositing them into the canister's cycles balance.

Cycles are used because, while the value of an ICP token is volatile, the value of cycles is pegged to [XDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_drawing_rights), a group of fiat currencies. This enables smart contracts on ICP to maintain a rather stable cost.
